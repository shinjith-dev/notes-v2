Networking, or computer networking, is the process of connecting two or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, routers or applications, to enable the transmission and exchange of information and resources.

Networked devices rely on communications protocols—rules that describe how to transmit or exchange data across a network—to share information over physical or wireless connections.

## Internet
The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself.

The first iteration of the Internet was within the **ARPANET** project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by **Tim Berners-Lee** by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW).

## WWW
WWW stands for World Wide Web and is commonly known as the Web. The WWW was started by CERN in 1989.  WWW is defined as the collection of different websites around the world, containing different information shared via local servers(or computers).
