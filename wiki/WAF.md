A WAF or web application firewall **helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet**.
It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others.
A WAF is a protocol layer 7 defense (in the OSI model), and is not designed to defend against all types of attacks.
