Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the **secure version of [[HTTP]]**, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website.
HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.
This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.
