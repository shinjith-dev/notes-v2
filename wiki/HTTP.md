The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links.
**HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack**.

## HTTP Request Methods
HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request. 
  There are a lot of HTTP methods but we'll cover the most common ones, although mostly you'll deal with the GET and POST method.
**GET**: This is used for getting information from a web server.
**POST**: This is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records
**PUT**: This is used for submitting data to a web server to update information
**DELETE**: This is used for deleting information/records from a web server.
